nixos (and home-manager) configuration for a practically-minded young cs major

moved to nixos after using arch for the vast majority of my linux career largely as a summer project in 2025

i encourage you not to use this configuration as is, even if i do: not very pretty, exceedingly simple, not very elegant, written stupidly

hosts:

vecna is a large, forboding desktop in a corsair 4000D airflow. looks wholly evil. appropriately named after a most evil lich

- ryzen 7800x3d
- 32 gb ram
- rog strix motherboard (which i kinda hate)
- xfx speedster 7900xtx

xanathar ii (my laptop) is an hp pavilion from a few years ago, named so due to its omnipresence (at least in my backpack)

- whatever is in one of those things

hope you enjoy reading my config files
